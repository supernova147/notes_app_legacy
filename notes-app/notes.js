function getNotes() { //function created that we will be exporting
    return ("Your notes...");
}



module.exports = getNotes //Old way of exporting a function to a new file
// export default getNotes //I had to include "default" & the written command is slightly different.
// Disregard the last comment, I'm approaching it the way Udemy has it; as close as possible.
